Finally, once you have collected numerical information, you likely will have different currencies: this can be chaotic, so let chatGPT guide you in the choice and deployment of an API to convert this column to a common currency of your choice (it can be USD, EUR or whatever you want).

So we are just inserting Euros and getting the inverted rates in each currencies as a dictionary. Thus, in the convert_currency function, we are dividing the amount by the rate (essentially the inverted rate) to get the value in our chosen common currency. In this way, we are just making one request for this API and getting our work of conversion done applying to each row of the dataframe. At the end, we are keeping that in the fees(EUR) column."
