    "## 7. Algorithmic Question \n",
    "Leonardo is an intern at a company. He is paid based on the total number of hours he has worked. They agreed __d__ days ago that Leonardo could not work less than $minTime_i$ or more than $maxTime_i$ hours per <ins>i-th</ins> day. Furthermore, he was warned by HR that on his last day at the company, he should provide a detailed report on how many hours he worked <ins>each day</ins> for the previous d days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today is the day Leonardo should report to HR, but the problem is that he <ins>didn't</ins> account for how many hours he put in for each day, so he only has the __total sum of the hours__ ($sumHours$) he put in total in these d days. He believes that if he creates a report in which each number $dayHours_i$ corresponds to the __total hours he worked on the i-th day__ while satisfying the HR limitations and the total sum of all $dayHours_i$ equals $sumHours$, he would be fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "He cannot create such a report independently and requests your assistance. He will give you the number of days $d$, total hours spent $sumHours$, and the HR limitations for each day $i$, and he wants you to assist him in determining whether it is possible to create such a fake report. If that is possible, make such a report. \n",

    "The first line of input contains two integers __d__, $sumHours$ - the number of days Leonardo worked there and the total number of hours he worked for the company.

    "Your solution's time complexity is __O(d)__, where __d__ is the number of days Leonardo worked. The reason behind this is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The main part of the solution is a loop that runs __d__ times, which happens to be the length of `min_times` and `max_times` lists. Here, each iteration of the loop represents one day of work for Leonardo. Inside this loop, you are performing a constant number of operations (like assignment, subtraction, and the min function), all of which have O(1) complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(days):\n",
    "    min_time = min_times[i]\n",
    "    max_time = max_times[i]\n",
    "\n",

    "    daily_hours[i] = min(max_time, hours_remaining)\n",
    "    hours_remaining -= daily_hours[i]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Before this loop, you are also calculating the sum of `min_times` and `max_times`. Both these operations will run in __O(d)__ time complexity since you're iterating through each element in the list once. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if total_hours < sum(min_times) or total_hours > sum(max_times):\n",
    "    print(\"NO\")\n",
    "    return\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the end, you're printing the `daily_hours` list which again is an operation with __O(d)__ time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, every significant operation in your solution is linearly dependent on the number of days, __d__. Hence, the final time complexity of your solution is __O(d)__."
