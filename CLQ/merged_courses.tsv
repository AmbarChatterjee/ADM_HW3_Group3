Extreme heat, flooding, and rising sea levels are leading to a number of dangerous and irreversible impacts on societies and economies. Avoiding the worst impacts depends on decisions we make today to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and to find solutions to remove carbon from the atmosphere. A course in climate change has never been so important, as we attempt to tackle these fundamental issues facing humanity in the 21st century. This highly interdisciplinary course offers a specialised knowledge of climate change from multiple perspectives, addressing many of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) around themes including climate science; impacts, adaptation and vulnerability; technological and nature-based mitigation; and the connections between climate change and human culture. Practical skills training is embedded in all modules and will provide vital hands-on experience in applying subject knowledge in the real world. There are also strong links with employers – notably through a careers module and an opportunity to undertake an employer-focused research project. This will ensure students graduate as the global citizens and leaders that society needs to help secure the future of our planet. This will open the doors to a wide variety of careers and pathways for future study – including the public sector (e.g. national meteorological and environmental agencies, and local councils), non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and charities; the private sector (e.g. environmental consultancies, energy and utilities companies, risk, finance and insurance providers); universities and research institutes; and many more.

Environmental Contamination and Toxicology (ECT+)	University of Bordeaux	Masters Programs	Full time	We do not know enough about the potential toxicity of the existing chemicals or the thousands of new ones being annually produced: we cannot test their toxicity to all species and thus effects of chemicals thought to be safe are constantly surprising us (i.e., endocrine disruptors, microplastics, nanoparticles etc.). In the last two decades, pioneering ecosystem health approaches were applied on the basis of physicochemical, biological and ecological parameters indicative of ecosystem welfare/harm. Despide of the great conceptual difficulty to cover the journey between values of individual parameters and the integrative measure of ecosystem health, the conceptual framework that integrates Environmental Contamination and Toxicology provides concepts and methods that, establishing cause-effect relationships with reasonable certainty, may be useful to interpret cost/effective data indicative of the ecosystem health status, exactly like biomarkers and bioassays are currently used in biomedical research and medical practice.

Global Energy and Climate Policy MSc	SOAS University of London	Centre for International Studies and Diplomacy	Full time&Part time	addresses important issues of our time.

More than two decades of political contestation have shown that a supportive policy environment – meaningful and consistent domestic laws and regulation underpinned by ambitious international treaties – is the only way to affect these changes, develop alternatives to emissions-intensive fossil fuels and transition economies around the world onto a secure, low-carbon and climate-friendly footing.

Global Health and Mental Health MSc	St George’s, University of London	Graduate School	Full time&Part time	Although mental health is now increasingly more understood as a topic, addressing mental health has been a neglected and overlooked aspect of healthcare. In many societies around the globe, experiences related to the mind are not conceptualised as a health issue. Developing mental health infrastructure as part of global health systems is a contemporary encounter with important conceptual and ethical questions. At the same time, increased globalisation is bringing forth travelling cultures and traditional understandings about mental illness. Orthodox healthcare practitioners and policy-makers are responding to phenomena such as spirit possession, accusations of child witchcraft, curses, and forced exorcisms. Exploring culture and mental health questions fundamental aspects of our existence such as our identity, customs, and symbolisms against the backdrop of a human rights discourse and the need to address treatment gaps in global mental health.

Health Economics (MSc)	Erasmus School of Economics	Masters Programmes	Full time	Health care is a major sector of a modern economy, accounting for 10-18% of GDP in high-income countries. Advances in medical technology generate substantial improvements in population health but also create major economic and social challenges. Health care costs are rising rapidly. Population ageing both increases the need for health care and reduces the fraction of people working to pay for it. Health inequalities remain stubbornly high and further reduce productivity. Low-income countries have the greatest need for health care but are least able to pay for it. If you are motivated to contribute solutions to these challenges, then the Health Economics programme at Erasmus will equip you with the analytical and quantitative skills techniques you need.

Investigating the genetic basis of sexual dimorphism in insect eye size	Durham University	Department of Biosciences	Full time	Sexual dimorphism is pervasive in animals, from the shape and size of individual organs and differences in overall body size to elaborate male ornaments. Compound eyes are a key sensory organ of insects and their size is often sexually dimorphic within species reflecting differences in female and male behaviour. Compound eyes are composed of facets or ommatidia and the number and width of ommatidia determines visual acuity and contrast sensitivity. FemaleDrosophila melanogasterfruit flies have larger eyes composed of more ommatidia than males. In XX flies theDrosophilafemale sex determination pathway is activated and regulates the gene regulatory network for eye development to generate more cells and more ommatidia. In XY flies the female sex determination pathway is switched off and smaller male eyes develop. How eye development responds to the sex determination pathway is not known. The aim of this project is to characterise these mechanisms by genetically masculinizing female fly eyes and using gene expression analysis to identify genes that change expression in response. This will identify how sex determination pathways integrate with the developmental gene regulatory networks that build organs to help reveal how organ size is specified and the mechanisms underlying differences between female and male sensory organs.

Investigation of brain anatomy across closely related bumblebee species, native to North-East England	Durham University	Department of Biosciences	Full time	Bumblebees are agriculturally important pollinators, but are currently declining in abundance in the UK and around the world, in part due to climate change (Soroye et al. 2020).Understanding these declines requires research on the biology and physiology of these species. Bumblebees are thought to be generalists, pollinating a variety of flower species. However, our preliminary observations conducted in Durham in summers 2020-22 indicate that different bumblebee species prefer different plants (see also Sikora et al. 2020). In addition, it has been reported that workers and drones of the same species also have different flower preferences. Bumblebees have been a preferred insect model for neuroethology and sensory neuroscience, however, most work has focused onBombus terrestrisin Europe (e.g. Li et al. 2017; Mertes et al. 2021) andBombus impatiensin North America (e.g. Mares et al. 2005), with other species receiving little attention. In addition, most studies, including our own (e.g. Riabinina et al. 2014, Langridge et al. 2021), have focused on the bees’ behaviours alone, leaving the neuronal and genetic basis of their behaviours poorly understood. Thus, the neuronal basis of bees’ diverse flower preferences is currently unknown.This project will investigate and compare brain anatomy of 8 species of bumblebees, native to North-East England. We will specifically focus of antennal and optic lobes – olfactory and visual processing centres of an insect brain.We hypothesize that the brain anatomy reflects species- and sex-specific behavioural preferences of the bees.

Marine Renewable Energy - MSc	Bangor University	College of Environmental Sciences and Engineering	Full time	To reduce greenhouse gas emissions and aid sustainable development, there is an urgent need to support our electricity generating capacity through the development of low carbon technologies, particularly those generated from renewable sources. The ocean represents a vast and largely untapped energy resource, that could be exploited as a form of low carbon electricity generation, and there is much European and global commercial and R&D activity in this energy sector. The UK is the world leader in the development of wave and tidal stream technologies, and if marine energy deploys globally, the UK is uniquely positioned to capture a substantial market share, with the potential to contribute as much as £4.3 bn to UK GDP up to 2050. The aim of this MSc programme is to equip students with the skills necessary to identify and quantify the potential of specific locations for marine renewable energy generation installations, with an emphasis on the resource (waves and tides), time series analysis, numerical modelling, and the challenges faced when placing arrays of devices in the marine environment.
