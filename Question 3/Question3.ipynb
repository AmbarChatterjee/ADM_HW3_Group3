    "- The function based on our new score processes all columns in our dataset and then goes to extract query-related documents by scrolling and 'weighing' each field in our dataset\n",
    "This leads us to conclude that in case a user enters a query in which there is the name of a specific country/university or a range of fees for his master degree program the function we described in 2.2 is definitely less effective than the new score we created because the latter goes and parses all the fields in the dataset.\n",

    "On the other hand if we use as a score the cosine similarity being a well-defined metric in the case where the query is the same when we go to apply the two score functions then in that case the precision is greater.\n",
    "So we can conclude that based on our dataset and how we have processed the columns and data what is the best score function depends on what we are interested in and then it depends on the particular query and we can attest this with just one example: **comparing the results of the function that uses cosine similarity and the one that uses our new score when the query is the same, i.e. 'advanced knowledge'**.\n",

    "Now, that we have both results we can do a comparative analysis of TF-IDF and New Score methods for retrieval based on the query \"advanced knowledge\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall briefly what these two methods do: the first method, the new score method applies a weighted scoring algorithm that considers multiple attributes of courses, instead the other, the TF-IDF method involves preprocessing course descriptions, creating a TF-IDF matrix, and then calculating cosine similarity scores between the query and each course description in the dataset, so the documents (courses) are ranked based on these similarity scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "What can we notice is that the execution of the TF-IDF method on a dataset of course descriptions resulted in a list of courses where titles and descriptions closely matched the query \"advanced knowledge\", indeed the top-10 results include courses like \"Advanced Computing (MSc/MRes)\" and \"Advanced Mechanical Engineering - MSc\", each with a corresponding similarity score, on the other hand our new score method retrieved a diverse set of courses, with scores based on the weighted sum of various attributes, this method provided a broader perspective, taking into account multiple factors beyond the textual similarity of course descriptions to the query. If we do a comparison what we find out is that the TF-IDF method demonstrated high relevance in its results, with courses closely aligned to the query and the high cosine similarity scores indicate a strong textual match, instead, the new score function, while offering a range of courses, did not match the direct relevance achieved by the TF-IDF method for the specific query used.\n",
    "We asked themselves on how it can be possible and we find out that maybe TF-IDF scores are based solely on textual relevance, making it highly effective for specific keyword-based queries instead the other method is a multifaceted approach and this allows for a more nuanced evaluation of courses, considering various attributes, which can be advantageous for more complex or multi-dimensional queries tant includes not only descprition texts but that can involve city, country, number to retry fees and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion as we said above, before the example, our score function is more adaptable, allowing for the adjustment of weights based on different criteria and this makes it suitable for a variety of queries and user preferences, instead the TF-IDF method is more suited for queries where direct textual relevance is paramount and for this reason for this specific example (usage of the query \"advanced knowledge\") we can say that the TF-IDF method outperformed the other method in terms of retrieving courses with direct textual relevance to the query. However, the method based on our new score strength lies in its adaptability and comprehensive approach, considering a wider range of course attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "So at the end what can we say it is that the choice between TF-IDF and new score methods should be guided by the specific needs of the query and the desired breadth of course retrieval"
